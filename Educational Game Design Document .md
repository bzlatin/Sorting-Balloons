\#\# Elevator Pitch  
Sorting Balloons is an interactive, engaging game that teaches players how sorting algorithms work through fun and intuitive mechanics. Players actively apply algorithms like Bubble Sort, QuickSort, and Merge Sort in real-time challenges while experiencing their strengths and weaknesses through gameplay. The game integrates strategic decision-making, speed-based challenges, and playful interactions to ensure that players naturally learn sorting concepts instead of memorizing definitions.

\#\# Influences (Brief)

\- Bloons Tower Defense:  
  \- Medium: Video Game  
  \- Explanation: The main theme of the game has to do with sorting balloons, which came from the idea of the defense game Bloons Tower Defense.  
\- CISC220 Data Structure and Algorithm  
  \- Medium: Course  
  \- Explanation: In CISC220, we were suddenly given more then 10 different sorting algorithms which was overwhelming to earn all at once. It was confusing how each sorting algorithm works.  
\- [https://daisywatson.github.io/algosort-game/](https://daisywatson.github.io/algosort-game/):  
  \- Medium: Educational Game  
  \- Explanation: We like how simple and intuitive this online game is, however it is not very fun. So, we will take inspiration for the sorting mechanics but make it fun and more enjoyable.

\#\# Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

\-Balloons with numbers appear on the screen, and players must sort them using different algorithms.  
\-Instead of simply dragging balloons into order, players apply specific sorting methods based on level objectives.  
\-Levels introduce increasing complexity, with added mechanics like moving balloons, obstacles, and sorting race challenges.  
\-Players can select a sorting algorithm at the beginning of levels, reinforcing strategic thinking.  
\-Power-ups and Abilities: Players earn speed boosts and special tools for efficient sorting.  
\-Visual Algorithm Representation: As players sort, animations visually depict how the algorithm processes the data.  
\-Mini-Games and Challenges: Includes multiple-choice questions, prediction challenges, and time-based sorting tasks.

\# Learning Aspects  
\-- Big-O  
\- Time Complexity  
\- Space Complexity  
\- Learn the basics instead of memorizing.  
\- Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort...ect.

\#\# Learning Domains  
\- Sorting algorithms  
\- Data Structure

\#\# Target Audiences  
\-Computer Science Students: University students learning sorting algorithms.  
\-High School STEM Programs: Introducing basic sorting concepts in an engaging way.  
\-Casual Learners: Gamified learning for individuals interested in improving problem-solving skills

\#\# Target Contexts

Used in University courses teaching students about Sorting Algorithms. It will replace the worksheet, which tries to help students visualize and memorize each sorting algorithm.

\#\# Learning Objectives

\- By the end of the game, players will be able to identify basic sorting algorithms and choose which are best for given scenarios.  
\- By the end of the game, players will be able to implement simple sorting algorithms using code.  
\- By the end of the game, players will be able to identify each algorithmâ€™s time complexity and space complexity.

\#\# Prerequisite Knowledge

\- Prior to the game, students should have a basic understanding of the different data structures (arrays, list linked list).  
\- Prior to the game, players need to be able have a basic understanding of Big-O Notation  
\- Prior to the game, players should have some basic programming experience, knowing how to use loops, arrays, etc.

\#\# Assessment Measures

- Point System: Correct sorting increases score; incorrect moves deduct points.  
- Efficiency Score: Players receive higher ratings for sorting with optimal steps.  
- Multiple choice questions after a few levels of the same topic to ensure understanding  
  - What algorithm is used in the video below?  
  - Consider the array: \[7, 2, 1, 6, 8, 5, 3, 4\]  
    - If we choose 4 as the pivot and apply one partition step in QuickSort, what would the array look like after partitioning?  
  - What is the time complexity of quicksort on a given list?

\# What sets this project apart?

\- Interactive Sorting: Unlike traditional static exercises, Sorting Balloons immerses players in active problem-solving.  
\- Fun & Strategy: The game transforms sorting into an engaging and competitive experience.  
\- Gamification: Power-ups, leaderboards, and character interactions enhance learning motivation.

\# Player Interaction Patterns and Modes

\#\# Player Interaction Pattern

Single-player experience with drag-and-drop, click-based, and physics-based interactions.

\#\# Player Modes

\- Single-player campaign: Progress through increasing challenges.  
\- Endless Mode: Race against time to continuously sort incoming balloon waves.  
\- Challenge Mode: Specific algorithm-based puzzles that must be solved under constraints.

\# Gameplay Objectives

\- Efficiently arrange balloons. Incorrect or slow sorting results in lost points or failed levels.  
\- Complete all levels to become a Master Sorter. Players progress through different algorithms and challenges.  
\- Make the Sorting Monkey Happy. A friendly character reacts to correct or incorrect sorting, providing immediate feedback.

\# Procedures/Actions

\- Drag-to-Swap Mode: Players can only swap adjacent balloons (Bubble Sort levels).  
\- Pick-and-Place Mode: Players select the smallest number and move it to the correct position (Selection Sort levels).  
\- Pivot Sorting Mode: Players must group numbers into smaller and larger sets around a pivot (QuickSort levels).

\# Rules

\- Sorting Efficiency Matters: Players are rewarded for fewer swaps and correct sorting choices.  
\- Limited Time: Balloons will pop if sorting takes too long.  
\- Adaptive Learning Paths: Mistakes lead to hints and revised level difficulty.

\# Objects/Entities

\- Balloons: Numbered entities that players must sort.  
\- Power-ups: Items that grant temporary sorting advantages.  
\- Obstacles: Random elements (e.g., wind, sticky balloons) that add difficulty.

\#\# Core Gameplay Mechanics (Detailed)

\- Drag-and-Swap Sorting:  
   \- Players interact with balloons using a drag-and-swap mechanic. Depending on the level, they may only swap adjacent balloons (Bubble Sort) or freely swap any two (Selection Sort). The system enforces algorithmic constraints, ensuring players experience sorting as it would happen computationally. A progress bar and feedback animations help players understand their sorting efficiency in real-time.  
\- Dynamic Sorting Challenges:  
   \- Players face different sorting challenges that vary based on the level. For example, in some levels, balloons may float around randomly, forcing the player to react quickly while maintaining the correct sorting order. Other levels may introduce wind or gravity mechanics, where balloons shift positions dynamically, requiring the player to adapt their sorting strategy in real-time. Some stages might require sorting balloons that appear sequentially rather than all at once, simulating Insertion Sort principles  
\- Sorting Race Challenges:  
   \- Players compete in timed sorting races against an AI opponent or against previous best scores. They must quickly choose the right sorting algorithm for the challenge. If they pick an inefficient algorithm, they will struggle to complete the level before the balloons overflow, reinforcing why some sorting methods are better in different scenarios. The AI may use different strategies, encouraging players to experiment with and compare sorting techniques.

      
\#\# Feedback

\- Instant Visual Feedback: Balloons glow green for correct placements, red for incorrect.  
\- Monkey Guide: Character reactions provide encouragement or guidance.  
\- Leaderboard & Score Tracking: Encourages improvement and replayability.  
\- Algorithm Insights: After each level, a summary explains how the chosen sorting method performed.
